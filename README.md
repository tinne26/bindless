# Bindless
My entry for [Ebitengine's first game jam ever](https://itch.io/jam/ebiten-game-jam)! Theme was "magnets".

You can find static binaries in the releases, or if you have Golang 1.18+, run directly with:
```
go run github.com/tinne26/bindless@latest
```

Bindless is a puzzle game with a dystopian background story. The puzzles are mostly simulations of levels with magnets, where you can poke and prod a few things in order to solve them.

## Controls
- You use the mouse and left-click to select and use your abilities.
- You press ESC on levels to reset them if you are locked.

Additional controls:
- You can press F to switch between fullscreen/windowed.
- You can also use 1-4 to make it easier to switch between abilities.
- You can also press ESC to skip the typewriter effect on story sections.
